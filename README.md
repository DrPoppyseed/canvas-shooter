[canvas-shooter](https://github.com/DrPoppyseed/canvas-shooter) is a simple game where you have to shoot down incoming
enemies to live as long as you can while they try and hit you themselves.

This project is heavily inspired by [ Chris's canvas shooter project ](https://github.com/chriscourses/games-101), but
with some noticeable differences.

- Fully Typescript implementation
- Use original state management library [ butcherjs ](https://github.com/DrPoppyseed/butcherjs)
